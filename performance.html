				<h1>6.Kolkata Knight Riders</h1>
				<p>Dinesh Karthik gave over the leadership to England's World Cup-winning skipper Eoin Morgan after a dismal start to the 2020 season in order to focus more on batting. After making some intriguing auction purchases, the franchise will be striving for a far stronger performance in 2021. Kolkata, like Chennai, has a devoted fan following that will be hoping for a better performance this time. </p>

				<h1>7.Sunrisers Hyderabad</h1>
				<p>In the previous two seasons, Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) has been a difficult team to beat. The Orange Army franchise had a fantastic season the previous year, making it to the playoffs.
